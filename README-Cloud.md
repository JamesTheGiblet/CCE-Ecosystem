 CCE Cloud
 
 **Access Anywhere. Observe Everything. Zero Risk.**

CCE Cloud is the web-based cockpit for the Cascade Compounding Engine.  
It gives you full visibility into how the engine behaves — without touching your money, requiring hardware, or storing API keys.

**Cloud is the proof layer of the CCE ecosystem.**

## What CCE Cloud Does NOT Do

- Does not execute trades
- Does not store API keys

## Why CCE Cloud Exists

Most trading systems are:

- Opaque
- Emotional
- Unpredictable
- Hype-driven
- Black boxes

**CCE Cloud is the opposite.**

It lets you:

- Watch the engine behave
- Understand the logic
- Verify the discipline
- See the philosophy in motion
- Build trust before committing to Node

**Cloud is the test drive — but live.**

## Who CCE Cloud Is For

- People who want to **learn** CCE
- People who want to **observe** CCE
- People who want to **evaluate** CCE before buying Node
- People who want **access from any device**

## FAQ

### Q: Is this a paper trading simulator?
**A:** Yes and no.  

It's not a "practice trading" tool.  
It's a **proof system** that shows you how the CCE behaves under real market conditions.  

The engine uses the same logic as Node, but doesn't execute trades.

---

### Q: Can I use Cloud to test my own strategies?
**A:** No.  

Cloud runs the CCE strategy only.  
It's designed to build trust in the CCE philosophy, not as a generic backtesting platform.

---

### Q: Does Cloud guarantee Node will perform the same way?
**A:** No.  

Cloud shows how the engine **behaves**.  
Node executes the same logic, but:
- Exchange fees differ
- Slippage varies
- Network conditions change
- Your capital affects position sizing

Cloud is transparency, not a performance promise.

---

### Q: Can I cancel anytime?
**A:** Yes.  

Monthly subscription. No contract. Cancel anytime.  
Data remains accessible for 30 days after cancellation.

---

### Q: What if I want to switch to Node later?
**A:** Perfect.  

That's the whole point of Cloud.  

Once you trust the logic, buy Node and run it yourself.  
Cloud subscribers get **£20 off Node** (one-time discount code).

---

### Q: Do you offer refunds?
**A:** First month only.  

If you're not satisfied within 30 days, email `support@gibletscreations.com` for a full refund.  
No questions asked.

## Philosophy

CCE Cloud exists because **transparency builds trust**.

In a space full of:
- Fake screenshots
- Survivorship bias
- Backtested lies
- Get-rich-quick promises

Cloud is different.

It shows you the **real engine**, making **real decisions**, in **real-time**.

No hype.  
No promises.  
No bullshit.

Just deterministic logic, observable behaviour, and verifiable results.
