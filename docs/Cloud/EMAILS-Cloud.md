# CCE Cloud Onboarding Sequence

**Audience:** New Cloud subscribers (£12/month)  
**Goal:** Education, trust-building, and eventual conversion to Node.  
**Tone:** Disciplined. Transparent. No hype.

## Email 1: Day 0 (Immediate)

**Subject:** Welcome to the cockpit.

Welcome to CCE Cloud.

You now have full visibility into the Cascade Compounding Engine. You aren't just looking at a chart; you are looking at a logic system that has been backtested over a decade of market cycles.

**Your First Steps:**

1. **Log in to your dashboard:** [cloud.cce.gibletscreations.com](https://cloud.cce.gibletscreations.com)
2. **Set your simulated capital:** We recommend setting this to an amount you actually intend to trade with later. It makes the psychology real.
3. **Check the Current State:** Is the engine DORMANT? Is it in CASCADE?

**What you are seeing:**
Cloud is the "proof layer" of our ecosystem. It runs the exact same logic as the CCE Node hardware, but without executing trades. It is designed to let you verify the discipline before you commit your capital.

Take a look around. Watch how the engine behaves.

We don't promise overnight riches. We promise discipline.

Welcome to the ecosystem.

## Email 2: Day 3

**Subject:** The 7 States of Discipline

Most traders lose money because they don't know *where* they are in the market cycle. They buy when they should wait. They sell when they should hold.

The CCE removes this guesswork by operating in **Seven Distinct States**.

When you look at your Cloud dashboard, you will always see one of these:

1. **DORMANT:** Extreme fear. We sit in USDT. We preserve capital.
2. **ANCHOR:** The first step back in. 33% allocation.
3. **IGNITION:** Trend confirmation. 67% allocation.
4. **CASCADE_1:** The bull run is on. 100% allocation.
5. **CASCADE_2:** Peak momentum. Tracking all-time highs.
6. **SPILLWAY:** Momentum is breaking. We start exiting.
7. **EXTRACTION:** The bear is back. We return to USDT.

The engine checks these conditions every 6 hours. It does not care about news, tweets, or hype. It only cares about data.

**[Check the Current State](https://cloud.cce.gibletscreations.com)**

Observe the logic. Trust the process.

## Email 3: Day 7

**Subject:** Why we don't predict

You might have noticed something about your Cloud dashboard:

**It doesn't predict the future.**

There are no "BTC to $100k" promises. There are no "Bottom is in" guarantees.

Prediction is a fool's game. The market is irrational, and trying to guess what it will do tomorrow is gambling.

**CCE is deterministic.**

It doesn't predict; it **responds**.

* If the trend is up and fear is gone → **We buy.**
* If the momentum breaks and structure fails → **We sell.**

It sounds simple, but doing it consistently—without emotion, for years on end—is incredibly difficult for a human. We get greedy. We get scared.

The engine does not.

That is why you are here. Not for a crystal ball, but for a discipline system.

Keep watching the dashboard. See how it responds to the market this week.

## Email 4: Day 14

**Subject:** From observation to execution

You have been watching the engine for two weeks.

You've seen the states. You've seen the logic. You've seen the discipline.

Cloud is excellent for **observation**, but it cannot build your wealth. To actually compound, you need **execution**.

**It might be time for a Node.**

CCE Node is the hardware execution layer. It runs the same logic you see in Cloud, but it connects to your Binance account and executes the trades for real.

* **Sovereign:** Your hardware, your keys.
* **Private:** No data leaves your device.
* **Autonomous:** Runs 24/7 without you.

As a Cloud subscriber, you have already taken the first step. If you are ready to let the engine run your real portfolio, we offer a discount for verified subscribers.

**Your Subscriber Benefit:**
Use code **`CLOUD-UPGRADE-20`** at checkout to get **£20 off** your Node order.

👉 **Order CCE Node**

If you aren't ready yet, that is fine. Cloud will keep showing you the truth for as long as you need.

Stay disciplined.

## Email 5: Day 30 (Retention/Check-in)

**Subject:** One month of clarity

You've been with CCE Cloud for a month.

Regardless of what the market did this month—whether it was boring, chaotic, or euphoric—I hope you felt something specific:

**Calm.**

That is the ultimate product we sell. Not just returns, but the peace of mind that comes from having a plan.

* If the market crashed, the engine had a plan (EXTRACTION).
* If the market rallied, the engine had a plan (CASCADE).
* If the market did nothing, the engine had a plan (DORMANT).

You didn't have to stare at charts at 3 AM. You didn't have to panic sell.

**A quick tip:**
Did you know you can replay historical cycles in the dashboard? Go to the "History" tab and select "2017 Bull Run" or "2020 Crash". It is the best way to understand how the engine handles extreme volatility.

**View History**

Thank you for trusting the logic.
