# CCE Pocket Onboarding Sequence

**Audience:** New Pocket subscribers (£5/month)  
**Goal:** App installation, notification tuning, and reinforcing the "calm" philosophy.  
**Tone:** Minimalist. Reassuring. Brief.

## Email 1: Day 0 (Immediate)

**Subject:** You are connected.

Welcome to CCE Pocket.

You have added the final layer to your ecosystem: **Presence.**

Your engine is running (on Cloud or Node), and now you can verify that fact from anywhere, instantly.

**Step 1: Download the App**
[App Store Link] | [Google Play Link]

**Step 2: Sign In**
Use your CCE account credentials.

* **Cloud Users:** It will sync automatically.
* **Node Users:** Ensure you are on the same WiFi as your Node for the initial handshake.

**Step 3: Glance**
Open the app. Look at the "Current State" card. Close the app.

That is the entire workflow.

Welcome to awareness without obsession.

## Email 2: Day 2 (Configuration)

**Subject:** Tune the signal.

The goal of Pocket is to reduce anxiety, not increase it.

If your phone buzzes every time Bitcoin moves 1%, we have failed.

**Recommended Notification Settings:**

1. **State Changes:** ON (Essential. Know when the regime changes.)
2. **Trades:** ON (Know when execution happens.)
3. **Market Noise:** OFF (You don't need hourly price alerts.)
4. **Performance:** WEEKLY (Zoom out.)

Go to **Settings > Notifications** in the app to adjust this.

Make Pocket a source of signal, not noise.

## Email 3: Day 5 (Philosophy)

**Subject:** Why you can't trade

You might have noticed there is no "Buy" or "Sell" button in Pocket.

This is intentional.

**Pocket is a read-only interface.**

We designed it this way for two reasons:

1. **Security:** If someone steals your phone, they cannot drain your portfolio.
2. **Psychology:** You cannot panic-sell from a bar, a dinner party, or your bed.

If you really need to intervene, you have to go to your computer, log into Cloud/Node, and make a deliberate decision. That friction saves portfolios.

Pocket is for looking. The engine is for doing.

## Email 4: Day 14 (Usage)

**Subject:** The 3-second rule

You've had Pocket for two weeks.

Hopefully, you are checking the market *less* than you used to.

Before Pocket, you probably doom-scrolled Twitter or refreshed charts to "get a feel" for the market.

Now, use the **3-Second Rule**:

1. **Open Pocket.**
2. **See "DORMANT" (or current state).**
3. **Close Pocket.**

If the state hasn't changed, there is nothing for you to do. The engine is handling it.

Go back to living your life.

## Email 5: Day 30 (Retention)

**Subject:** Peace of mind?

It's been a month.

The market has likely moved up, down, and sideways in that time.

The question isn't "How much money did you make?" (The engine handles the compounding over years).

The question is: **"How did you sleep?"**

If Pocket has given you the confidence to step away from the charts and trust the system, then it is doing its job.

If you have feedback on the app—widgets you want, notifications you're missing—reply to this email. I read every response.

Stay calm.

### Cancellation Survey

**Subject:** One quick question

I see you've cancelled your Pocket subscription.

I assume this means you're either:

1. Leaving the ecosystem entirely.
2. Happy with just Cloud/Node and don't need mobile updates.

If you have a moment, I'd love to know which it is.

[Link to 1-question survey]

Your app will revert to "Demo Mode" at the end of the billing cycle.

### Alert: Connection Lost (Node Users Only)

**Subject:** Pocket cannot reach your Node

Your Pocket app hasn't been able to sync with your Node for 24 hours.

**Troubleshooting:**

1. Is your Node powered on?
2. Is your Node connected to the internet?
3. (If using local sync) Have you been on the same WiFi network recently?

*Note: If you are travelling, this is normal. Pocket shows the last known state until you reconnect.*
