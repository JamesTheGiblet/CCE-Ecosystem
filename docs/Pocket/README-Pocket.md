## Why CCE Pocket Exists

**People want to feel connected to their system.**

Pocket answers:

- "What state are we in right now?"
- "Did anything change today?"
- "Is the market safe?"
- "Am I still on track?"

It's the **emotional layer** of the ecosystem.

CCE is built for discipline, not obsession.  
Cloud gives you full visibility.  
Node gives you execution.  

**Pocket gives you peace of mind.**

---

## Who CCE Pocket Is For

- People who want **updates on the go**
- People who want **clarity** without the full dashboard
- People who want **peace of mind** between checks
- People who want **mobile notifications** when states change
- People who **trust the engine** but still want to stay aware

---

## How It Works

### 1. Connect to Your Engine

Pocket syncs with:

- **Cloud** subscribers (automatic sync)
- **Node** operators (via local API)
- **Both** (if you run Node + subscribe to Cloud)

**Setup time: 30 seconds**

```
1. Download Pocket app
2. Sign in with Cloud account
3. (Optional) Connect to Node via IP address
4. Done
```

### 2. Receive Notifications

Pocket sends push notifications when:

- **State transitions** occur  
  `DORMANT → ANCHOR: Market fear subsiding`

- **Trades execute** (Node only)  
  `Bought 0.0342 BTC at $98,450`

- **Performance milestones** hit  
  `Portfolio +25% vs starting capital`

- **Market alerts** trigger  
  `BTC Fear & Greed: 8 (Extreme Fear)`

**Notification frequency: Low**  
Pocket is not designed to spam you.  
You'll get 1-5 notifications per week on average.

- Both

You must have at least one active.

---

### Q: Can I use Pocket to control the engine?

**Average battery impact: <1% per day**

**A:** Yes.  

Turn off all notifications in settings.

### Q: What if I lose my phone?

Pocket is just a **view** into Cloud/Node.  
If you lose your phone:

1. Your Node keeps trading (unaffected)

4. Sign in
5. Resume where you left off

**Pocket has no control over execution.**

---

### Q: Can multiple people use Pocket with the same Node?

## Philosophy

CCE Pocket exists because **awareness ≠ obsession**.

In a world where:

- Apps are designed for addiction
- Notifications create anxiety
- Constant checking becomes compulsion
- FOMO drives bad decisions

**Pocket is different.**

It gives you just enough information to feel connected.  
Not so much that you become obsessed.

Pocket says:

- "The engine is working"
- "Nothing requires your attention"
- "You can go live your life"

**Discipline requires trust.**  
**Trust requires awareness.**  
**Awareness requires Pocket.**
