# Cascade Compounding Engine

**Sovereign. Deterministic. Disciplined.**

---

## What is CCE?

The Cascade Compounding Engine is a **rules-based cryptocurrency trading system** that removes emotion, prediction, and guesswork from long-term Bitcoin accumulation.

CCE runs a seven-state machine that moves capital between BTC and USDT based on strict, deterministic conditions — no hunches, no hype, no hope.

**Historical Performance (2013-2024 backtest):**

- Total Return: +18,639%
- Alpha vs BTC Buy-and-Hold: +3,320%
- Max Drawdown: -34%
- Win Rate: 73%

**Past performance ≠ future results. Trading involves risk of loss.**

---

## The Philosophy

Most trading systems are:

- **Opaque** — You don't know why they trade
- **Emotional** — They react to fear and greed
- **Unpredictable** — You can't trust the behaviour
- **Hype-driven** — Promises, not discipline

**CCE is the opposite.**

Every decision follows deterministic rules.  
Every state transition is logged and explainable.  
Every trade executes without emotion or prediction.

**CCE doesn't predict the future. It responds to the present.**

---

## How It Works

### The Seven-State Machine

CCE operates through seven distinct states, each with strict entry and exit conditions:

**1. DORMANT**  
Waiting in USDT during extreme market fear.  
*Position: 100% USDT*

**2. ANCHOR**  
First BTC position when fear begins to subside.  
*Position: 33% BTC, 67% USDT*

**3. IGNITION**  
Market shows recovery signals.  
*Position: 67% BTC, 33% USDT*

**4. CASCADE_1**  
Bull trend confirmed.  
*Position: 100% BTC*

**5. CASCADE_2**  
Strong momentum, tracking all-time highs.  
*Position: 100% BTC*

**6. SPILLWAY**  
Momentum weakening, exits triggered.  
*Position: Gradually reducing BTC exposure*

**7. EXTRACTION**  
Bear trend confirmed, return to safety.  
*Position: 100% USDT*

### Decision Inputs

CCE evaluates:

- BTC price and trend direction
- Fear & Greed Index (market sentiment)
- Moving averages and momentum
- Time since last check
- Current state and position

**Checks occur every 6 hours.**  
**Trades execute only when state transitions trigger.**

### No Leverage. No Prediction

CCE is built for **long-term compounding through discipline**, not short-term speculation.

- No leverage (1x only)
- No prediction (responds to data)
- No emotion (deterministic logic)
- No overtrading (averages 8-12 trades per cycle)
